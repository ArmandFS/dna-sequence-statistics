# dna-sequence-statistics
### Hello! This repository is for a python/jupyter notebook project that is about sequence statistics. Here, I take a file that contains RNA/DNA/Genome data (usually in the fasta format) and then I proceed to do some sequential analysis, such as plotting the nitrogen bases, ac-gt density plots, calculating the total number of nitrogen bases, dimers, etc.
